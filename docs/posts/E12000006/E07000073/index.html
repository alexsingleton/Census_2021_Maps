<p>The following R code can be used to generate a map for Harlow using the data and boundaries found on this website. You should be able to re-create or adapt the code to make maps like those that you can download, or even make an interactive version of the maps! In this code we refer to the boundaries and census tables generically; but remember that you can download the boundaries for Harlow <a href="E07000073.gpkg">here</a>; and for the example of mapping the “Economically Inactive”, the relevant census table “Economic activity status” can be downloaded <a href="E07000073_ts066.csv">here</a>.</p>
